# Web Scrapy League of Legends Info ðŸ•¸

## Description 

This script will do a web scrapy in the website op.gg to get information like runes, speels and build of same champion in the lane typed and it will be used in a future project of a discord bot to bring information about what champion or lane typed in the command.

The python language was chosen beacause in addtion to be my favorite language i want to practice my studies and test my knowledge.

The "hardest" part of this project was when I had to analyze the code, but after some time analyzing the code I can see the best way to get the information.
